## Karazhan 40 - Full Changelog
Relative to pepopo978's BigWigs.
### General

* Fixed various triggers and unit tests being based on formatted logs, eg " (1)".
* Changed a few sound effects.
* Added BigWigs:BuffNameByIndex(buffIndex) to Core.lua allowing to distinguish between buffs/debuffs with the same icon (loads the buffs into a virtual tooltip to read their name).
* Fixed some settings potentially breaking other (seemingly independent) features.
* Debuff-based warnings that require immediate player action (eg bomb, corruption, etc) are now triggered locally to avoid issues with synchronization and throttling.
### Trash
